AI Interaction Log

Step 1: First Question to AI
I started by asking AI to make two versions of a shopping list program in Python. I told it about the rules:
- Only use Week 1–3 concepts.
- No lists, no dictionaries, no functions, and no files.
- Use only simple variables like strings and integers.

Step 2: First Answer from AI
AI gave me code, but it used lists. I knew this was not allowed for my assignment, so I decided not to use it.
This taught me that I cannot just copy the first answer. I need to carefully check if it matches my teacher’s instructions.

Step 3: Asking Again (Refining My Prompt)
I asked again more clearly:
“Please rewrite the shopping list code without using lists, dictionaries, or functions. Use only string variables.”

Step 4: Second Answer from AI
This time, AI gave me two versions:
1. A messy beginner version with short variable names and poor formatting.
2. A clean version with clear variable names, good spacing, and comments.

Both worked correctly, but the style was very different.

Step 5: Testing and Fixing
I tested the programs in Google Colab:
- Adding items worked.
- Viewing items showed them correctly.
- Removing items worked, but sometimes the item count became negative.

I fixed this by making sure the count only goes down if the item actually exists.

Step 6: My Own Touch
- I improved some user messages to be more clear and polite.
- I kept the messy version “bad but working” (on purpose) to match the assignment.
- I made the clean version neat, easy to read, and commented properly.

Challenges I Faced
- The hardest part was stopping myself (and AI) from using Python lists, because that is the usual way to solve this problem.
- Another challenge was creating a messy version that still worked. It felt strange to write “bad” code on purpose.

Reflection
Using AI helped me a lot, but I learned that:
- I must guide AI carefully with clear prompts.
- I should not accept everything AI gives me.
- Testing the program myself is very important.

In the end, AI gave me ideas, but the decisions, corrections, and final touches were mine. This process made me understand good coding practices better.
